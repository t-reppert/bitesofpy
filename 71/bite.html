<p>In this Bite you write a small class to keep track of the max score in a game. When called as a function it receives a new score and returns the max score.</p><p>So calling it like this:<br><pre>
record = RecordScore()
print(record(10))
print(record(9))
print(record(11))
print(record(7))
</pre></p><p>.. would give the following outputs (11 becomes the new max score): <pre>
10
10
11
11
</pre><p>To achieve this implement the <code>__call__</code> dunder (special) method on the <code>RecordScore</code> class. Good luck!</p>
