<p>In this bite you will implement a <code>BridgeHand</code> class representing a collection of 13 playing cards randomly chosen from a 52-card <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_playing_cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French deck</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each card features a suit (spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs) and a rank</p>
<p>(Ace, King, Queen, Jack and then 10 to 2). Both suits and ranks are ordered as</p>
<p>indicated. Data structures for <code>Suit</code>, <code>Rank</code>, and <code>Card</code> have been provided to you.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The <code>__init__</code> constructor for your class should expect a sequence of <code>Card</code> objects. Attempts to use non-sequential types should raise a <code>TypeError</code> exception, and sequences containing values of types other than <code>Card</code> - or holding fewer or more than 13 elements - should raise <code>ValueError</code>.</p>
<p>Your class will also need to implement a <code>__str__</code> method returning a textual representation of the hand, sorted by suit and rank, eg: <strong>S:AK32 H:QJT4 D:9654 C:3</strong>. Note that the <strong>10</strong> rank should be represented as a capital <strong>T</strong>.</p>
<p>Ensure that spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs follow each other in that order, skipping over voids (eg, no cards in that suit).</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>Additionally, your class must implement the following read-only properties:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <code>hcp</code>: high card points. Count 4 points for each Ace, 3 for each King, 2 for each Queen and 1 for each Jack.</p>
<p>- <code>doubletons</code>: number of suits containing only two cards.</p>
<p>- <code>singletons</code>: number of suits containing just one card.</p>
<p>- <code>voids</code>: number of suits containing zero cards (that is, no cards in that suit).</p>
<p>- <code>ssp</code>: short suit points. Count 1 point for each doubleton, 2 for each singleton, and 3 for each void.</p>
<p>- <code>total_points</code>: sum of HCP and SSP.</p>
<p>- <code>ltc</code>: losing trick count. Considering only the top three cards in each suit, LTC is determined by examining each suit and assuming that an Ace will never be a loser, nor will a King in a 2+ card suit, nor a Queen in a 3+ card suit; accordingly:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - a void = 0 losing tricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - a singleton other than an A = 1 losing trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - a doubleton AK = 0; Ax or Kx = 1; Qx or xx = 2 losing tricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - a three card suit AKQ = 0; AKx, AQx or KQx = 1 losing trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - a three card suit Axx, Kxx or Qxx = 2; xxx = 3 losing tricks.</p>
