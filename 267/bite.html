<p>In this algorithm Bite, the challenge is to measure the size of an island in the ocean, based on the 2D map that you have been provided.</p>
<p>In this map, 0 represents <em>ocean</em> and 1 <em>land</em>.</p>
<p>You can assume there is only one island on the map, you need to measure its size (or <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/perimeter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perimeter</a>).</p>
<p>The matrix cells are connected horizontally and vertically, not diagonally.</p>
<p>Here is an example:<br /><img src="https://bites-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Island_size.PNG" alt="island size example" /></p>
<p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
