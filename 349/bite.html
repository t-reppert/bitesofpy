<p>Bob is a lazy typer and often forgets to accentuate his Spanish 😅</p>
<p>For example instead of <em>Cuando era pequeño me gustaba jugar en la vía</em> he would write: <em>Cuando era pequeno me gustaba jugar en la via</em>.</p>
<p>But Python to the rescue 🐍 ... help him out by finishing the <code>get_accentuated_sentence()</code>&nbsp;function that receives a text as input argument and accentuates it using the provided (downloaded) Spanish dictionary stored in the <code>SPANISH_WORDS</code> constant (a list of Spanish word strings).</p>
<p>Take a look at the <code>unicodedata</code> (Standard Library) module in order to make the link "accentuated -&gt; not-accentuated" word (e.g. <em>&eacute;xito</em> -&gt; <em>exito</em>), that should make it easier to complete this exercise 💡</p>
<p>By the way, note we kept the scope pretty simple here. Plural words nor verbs are expected to work. And there are some false positives, e.g. <em>una</em> (a) -&gt; <em>u&ntilde;a</em> (nail). So the solution is not very real-world applicable. To meet that criteria we would have to implement stemming to recognize all forms of a word, even the conjugated ones.</p>
<p>However we think this is still a useful exercise to sharpen your coding skills, so good luck and keep calm and code in Python 💪</p>
