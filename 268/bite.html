<p>Inspired by the movie <em>Transformer</em>, John decides to design a "number transformer" as a test. </p>

<p>It is capable to perfom the transformation of the number 1 (one is the base) to any "target" number.</p>

<p>The two allowed operations/rules are:</p>

<ol>
<li>multiply by 2</li>

<li>int divide by 3</li>
</ol>

<p>The operations can be chained repeatedly, and maybe just needs to run one of the rules. </p>

<p>Let's see an example:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Convert 1 (base number) to 10 (target number) = 6 operations:</p>

<p><code>1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 // 3 * 2 = 10</code></p></li>

<li><p>Convert 1 (base number) to 8 (target number) = 3 operations:</p>

<p><code>1 * 2 * 2 * 2 =  8</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>After some manual testing with a few small numbers, it seems to be working just fine.</p>

<p>But what about bigger numbers? What if the number is greater than 10?</p>

<p>Can you help him to design a function to mearsure the efficiency, aka, how many operations it will take to convert 1 (the base) to the asking target number?</p>

<p>[Hint] the data structure is the key here.</p>
