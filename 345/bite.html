<p>Up to this point anyone can modify food entries in the food log API, for any user!</p>
<p>That is not desired and in this Bite we will have you lock down the API.</p>
<p>You'll work through the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens guide</a> adding all the pieces to effectively make the API secure using using JWT tokens and secure password hashing. You'll use FastAPI's elegant <code>Depends()</code> to lock down the endpoints that were copied over from a previous Bite.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>This Bite concludes the FastAPI learning path. Stay tuned for an SQLModel learning path where we build a similar API but using an ORM / database for persistence.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback on this learning path use the feedback form upon completing any of the Bites or hit us up directly <a href="https://pybit.es/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Slack</a>.</p>
